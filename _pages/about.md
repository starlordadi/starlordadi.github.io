I am an Undergraduate Student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. My research interests lie along the intersection of Optimization Theory, Optimal Control, Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning. I have a deep interest in autonomous vehicles and robotics and love to learn and work on exciting projects in these fields.
