excerpt: 'The system paper of our participation in International Ground Vehicle Competition-2019. It encapsulates the work of developing a fully autonomous ground vehicle from scratch capable of traversing structured environments with obstacles. Focuses on each module of the robot including mechanical structure, embedded architecture, high level controls and motion planning using Timed Elastic Band approach, Computer Vision pipeline to map the camera feed into an obstacle map including lanes and the system integration of all the modules using ROS.'
